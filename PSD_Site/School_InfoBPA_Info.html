                <h3>What the school environment is like</h3>
                <p>Now that you've learned what the environment of the class is like, let's go over what the environment of the school itself is like.
                    Overall, the environment is what you'd expect to find in any highschool. It's nice for the most part, but given how this is preparing you for a professional environment, you do have to wear your uniform every day unless told otherwise.
                    Plus, like I mentioned in the class page, it's not too hard to make friends outside of programming. As long as you find some people you like and don't overthink it, making friends isn't a hard task to accomplish.
                    After all, you're still in highschool, it wouldn't be right to go through it by yourself. At the end of the day, the environment of the school is pretty much the same as whatever home school you came from, just don't get kicked out for being stupid.
