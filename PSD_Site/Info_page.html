                <h3>What exactly is programming, and why should you choose it?</h3>
                <p>So you're interested in the programming course here at Eastland, that's awesome! But maybe you're not sold on
                    the class just yet or have no knowledge of programming and are thinking of going into something else because of that.
                    Well, I can assure you, that having no prior knowledge doesn't matter. Speaking from personal experience here, I had no 
                    idea what I was doing the first time I walked through those double doors and sat down at my desk for the first time.
                    I will admit, it was a little intimidating at first and it could get overwhelming at times, but I quickly learned just how many people there were I could turn to when something confused me.
                    Whether it was Mr. Roeth himself, or one of my friends, there was always someone who could help me figure out what I needed to do.
                    Speaking of that, if you go into this class, you could find some genuinely great friends, even if at first the friendship just starts out with you going to their desk to ask if they understood something better than you did, then it turns into a conversation where you're discussing your favorite games and nerding out together.
                    In short, if you do go into this class, you won't regret your decision, and if you do, that's fine. At the end of the day, this class won't be for everyone.
